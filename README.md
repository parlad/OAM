OAM - Online Ads Management

I feek like online advertisement is wild and unmanaged. Youtube manage to dissipoint me everytime with wild ads. I feel like it's a time to change. I want to manage ads with user related content. I think it's time to analysis little more before we send rendom ads to the users. 

I fill ads these days are sraight flooding of nonsense and garbage. I want to build the system that at least analys user content and making add more personalize to users. I know that i do sound straight negetive about the ads contents but i buyed nothing from the ads content supplied to me. Alos i am hugly dissapointed with the ads i have to see.

 # Million Dollor Homepage: This is website with most ads in it
 The Million Dollar Homepage is a website conceived in 2005 by Alex Tew, a student from Wiltshire, England, to raise money for his university education. The home page consists of a million pixels arranged in a 1000 × 1000 pixel grid; the image-based links on it were sold for $1 per pixel in 10 × 10 blocks. The purchasers of these pixel blocks provided tiny images to be displayed on them, a URL to which the images were linked, and a slogan to be displayed when hovering a cursor over the link.
