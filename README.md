OAM - Online Ads Management

I feek like online advertisement is wild and unmanaged. Youtube manage to dissipoint me everytime with wild ads. I feel like it's a time to change. I want to manage ads with user related content. I think it's time to analysis little more before we send rendom ads to the users. 

I fill ads these days are sraight flooding of nonsense and garbage. I want to build the system that at least analys user content and making add more personalize to users. I know that i do sound straight negetive about the ads contents but i buyed nothing from the ads content supplied to me. Alos i am hugly dissapointed with the ads i have to see.

  - Web page ads flooding
  
  
 # Million Dollor Homepage: This is website with most ads in it
 The Million Dollar Homepage is a website conceived in 2005 by Alex Tew, a student from Wiltshire, England, to raise money for his university education. The home page consists of a million pixels arranged in a 1000 × 1000 pixel grid; the image-based links on it were sold for $1 per pixel in 10 × 10 blocks. The purchasers of these pixel blocks provided tiny images to be displayed on them, a URL to which the images were linked, and a slogan to be displayed when hovering a cursor over the link.

# social media tracking: 
Word from Gabriel Weinberg, CEO & Founder, DuckDuckGo (2008-present)/[Post From Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-biggest-tracker-networks-and-what-can-I-do-about-them/answer/Gabriel-Weinberg):When you visit a website, you are of course observable by the site itself, but you are also observable by third-party trackers that the site embeds in its code. You might be surprised to learn that the vast majority of websites include many of these third-party trackers. Websites include them for a variety of reasons, like for advertising, analytics, and social media.Each third-party tracker exposes some of your personal information to the company behind it. Further, when the same tracker is littered over many of the world’s websites, the company behind it can create a massive data collection by combining the data its tracker collects on each site. With so much data from so many websites, these widespread trackers (and the companies behind them) can develop extensive individual profiles, which can include browsing, location, search, and purchase history. Then, these profiles can be used for anything, including following you around the web with creepy advertising.
